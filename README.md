# Droplet (Character from TBP)

This project is aiming to showcase my C++ capabilities in Unreal Engine 5 with C++. I'm focusing on creating an easy-to-compile version of The Blue Path's player character.

I worked for 8 months on The Blue Path project as the sole programmer. Here's the link to the project on Itch.io: https://sibyllion.itch.io/the-blue-path

The goal is to be able to test the character as a whole in a friendly way, with revised code.
